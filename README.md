Experiment with AMM Impermanent Loss

I consider a liquidity pool where one asset in the pool is a stablecoin, e.g., USDC, USDT, or DAI. The other asset is an altcoin, e.g., ETH.

AMM market follows a simple equation: asset1 volume * asset2 volume = k, where k is a constant. The LP provider provides equal value of two assets. For instance, a user must provide 50% ETH + 50% DAI in order to participate in the pool.

In this experimentation, I examine the permanent loss: the revenue difference between being a LP provider and simple buy-and-hold strategy.
